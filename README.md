# Wall-Finishing Robot Control System

Path planning software for autonomous wall-finishing robots. Generates optimal trajectories while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- Sweep-line path generation with obstacle avoidance
- Real-time trajectory visualization
- Coverage area and efficiency calculations
- Trajectory storage and replay
- Configurable tool widths and safety margins

## How It Works

The system divides walls into horizontal strips and plans efficient back-and-forth patterns. When obstacles are encountered, the robot navigates around them using calculated safety margins.

**Input**: Wall dimensions, obstacle positions, tool specifications  
**Output**: Complete robot trajectory with waypoints and metrics

## Technical Details

### Path Planning Algorithm
1. Calculate sweep lines based on tool width
2. Identify obstacle-free segments on each line
3. Generate continuous path connecting all segments
4. Apply safety margins around obstacles
5. Optimize for minimum travel distance

### Safety System
- Obstacles expanded by tool radius plus clearance buffer
- Collision detection for all planned movements
- Minimum gap width validation
- Path continuity verification

### Metrics
- Coverage area (mÂ²)
- Total path length (m)
- Coverage efficiency (%)
- Estimated completion time

## API Endpoints

```
POST /plan-trajectory/     # Generate new trajectory
GET  /trajectories/        # List all trajectories  
GET  /trajectories/{id}    # Get specific trajectory
GET  /trajectories/{id}/metrics  # Get detailed metrics
```

## Configuration

Wall dimensions: 0.1-50m width, 0.1-20m height  
Tool width: 0.05-1.0m  
Obstacles: Up to 20 per wall  
Safety clearance: Configurable, default 5cm

## Usage
